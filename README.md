# rockPaperScissor-Game

Rock, paper, and scissors game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to make a rock, paper, or scissors. It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player. We will be designing the game using JavaScript where a player will be playing against the computer. In total there will be 10 moves. The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors. A random option will be generated from the computerâ€™s side and the one who wins will get one point every time. After 10 moves are over the final result will be displayed on the screen with a button to restart the game. The game will be completely responsive so that it can be played on every device
